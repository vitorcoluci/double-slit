This repository contains two codes developed by Celso G. de Oliveira Jr and Vitor R. Coluci. The codes are used to control an steeped motor with Arduino and to collect and exhibit the light intensity patterns produced on Young's double-slit experiments. The codes were used to produce the article "Light interference pattern measurements from automatized low-cost Young's double-slit experiments" submitted to American Journal of Physics. All the work was developed on the School of Technology, University of Campinas, SP, Brazil.

The first code is the code to be uploaded in the Arduino, written in C, that will control a stepped motor, collect voltage data and send them to the serial port to be visualized with Processing.

The second code is the Processing code that exhibits the voltage data in real-time in a graph.
